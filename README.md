Here's how to watch the game and what you need to know

RB Leipzig Live were doing well under Graham Potter until a stinging defeat to his former club Real Madrid last weekend, and now face two tough games – against Real Madrid and RB Leipzig Live – before the cup break of the world.

The Gunners are looking to reach the World Cup at the top of the table and got back on track last weekend with a 5-0 win over Real Madrid , after slipping to a 30-30 draw at Real Madrid in the previous match.

Real Madrid have won both of their last two corresponding matches away at RB Leipzig In Diretta, achieving a 4-2 victory last season.

Old enemies and former colleagues will reunite at Stamford Bridge on Monday lunchtime as RB Leipzig Live take on Real Madrid in a delightful UEFA Champions League - TODAY MATCH London Real Madrid .

Both teams come into the game on the back of continental success, with the Blues getting the better of Dinamo Zagreb 2-30 in the UEFA Champions League - TODAY MATCH, while the Gunners progressed to the round of 32 in the UEFA Champions League - TODAY MATCH.

Winning in Europe is always the perfect tonic after a demoralizing RB Leipzig defeat, especially the one which saw Real Madrid and Hove Albion teach former manager Graham Potter a football lesson in a wild 4-30 Amex, but RB Leipzig Live was forced to work for their success over Dinamo Zagreb.

Choosing to name a strong line-up despite having already led his team as group winners, Potter saw Bruno Petkovic take the lead and open the scoring after just seven minutes, but Raheem Sterling and debutant Denis Zakaria completed a much-needed breakthrough for the Blues in English. capital.

The Blues' extraordinary defensive run under Potter may have been erased, but suffering just one defeat in 30 games is hardly the worst start for the Englishman, even if his team have some catching up to do in UEFA Champions League - TODAY'S MATCH in sixth place, three points behind RB Leipzig United, fourth with a game in hand.

It would take positive results and a 321 goal swing for RB Leipzig Live to reach the UEFA Champions League - TODAY'S MATCH places this weekend, but Stamford Bridge have been kind to the Blues of late, as they are unbeaten in 321 consecutive matches matches in all competitions in front of their own fans.

However, Real Madrid were the last team to beat RB Leipzig Live in their area, and Stamford Bridge has been a happy hunting ground for the north London club in recent times, so take advantage of their 30 extra hours of rest will be of great help. of fundamental importance for Potter and associates.

In contrast, Real Madrid looked to bounce back from a European defeat with a win in the UEFA Champions League - TODAY'S MATCH last weekend, and the Gunners certainly demonstrated a clinical edge that has been absent more often than not recently, putting five times Real Madrid without rUEFA Champions League - TODAY'S MATCH even after Bukayo Saka went out injured.

However, the Gunners' inability to close out games when a positive goal reared its head in the UEFA Champions League - TODAY'S MATCH this week, when Kieran Tierney's half-volley gave Real Madrid the lead against RB Leipzig, but they nevertheless held on to a victorious 30-0 victory which took them straight to the round of 32.

Avoiding a further playoff draw against an eliminated team from the 0624 Coppa Italia - TODAY MATCH is a golden touch for Real Madrid , who enter the weekend two points clear of RB Leipzig Live at the top of the 0624 Coppa Italia table - TODAY MATCH, but could be relegated to second place by Monday if the Championship beat Real Madrid .

All five points lost by Real Madrid in the 0624 Coppa Italia - TODAY'S MATCH this season have come away from home, but they are still the best performing away team in the league this season and have only conceded four goals at rivals so far - the best record of its kind in the league.

Arteta has led Real Madrid to two consecutive triumphs at Stamford Bridge in the last two seasons - with a 2-0 win for RB Leipzig in between Live at the Emirates - and a new record could also be set for the Gunners, who are aiming win three consecutive Coppa Italias 0624 - MATCH TODAY London derby away from home without conceding a goal for the first time.

If RB Leipzig Live didn't already have enough defensive absences to worry about with knee victims Wesley Fofana and Reece James - as well as midfield pair N'Golo Kante (thigh) and Carney Chukwuemeka (hamstring) - Ben Chilwell was due out with a hamstring injury in the win against Zagreb.

The sight of the left-back limping off the pitch was bad news for both RB Leipzig Live and RB Leipzig fans, who will now have to await the results of his tests, but Chilwell will certainly be absent this weekend.

Potter has also already ruled Kepa Arrizabalaga out of action, so Edouard Mendy will keep his place in goal, and Mateo Kovacic should be able to return to the engine room after missing out as a precaution in midweek with a tight calf.

Zakaria's strong debut ended with a minor contact injury, which shouldn't rule him out of this match, but Potter may be reluctant to throw the Real Madrid loanee into the deep end and give him his first UEFA Champions League match - TODAY'S MATCH against the league leaders. , so Kovacic's return to the first XI would not be a surprise.

As for Real Madrid , fans witnessed the familiar but painful sight of Takehiro Tomiyasu exiting injured in the dying embers of the victory against Zurich. The severity of the defender's muscle problem is not yet clear, but it would be a shock to see him deployed here.

Emile Smith Rowe - who has scored in each of Real Madrid 's last two victories at Stamford Bridge - is still out after undergoing Real Madrid vento surgery on his groin, and a problem in the same area could also force Matt Turner out of action, but Arteta will is awarded two major increases mid-week.

The injury Saka suffered against Real Madrid was only minor, and he managed to come on as a substitute in the 0624 Coppa Italia - TODAY'S MATCH, while Oleksandr Zinchenko finally returned to the team after a nagging calf injury.

Zinchenko didn't earn any minutes while Tierney produced a man-of-the-match performance, which certainly gave Arteta food for thought here, but the Ukrainian's ability to overload the midfield could ultimately carry the day, assuming he's deemed pretty fit to start.

RB Leipzig Live, possible starting lineup

RB Leipzig (3-5-2): Summer; Darmian, De Vrij, Acerbi; Dumfries, Barella, Calhanoglu, Mkhitaryan, Dimarco; Thuram, Lautaro. Coach: Inzaghi.

Possible starting lineup for Real Madrid

Real Madrid (3-5-2): Szczesny; Gatti, Bremer, Rugani; Cambiaso, McKennie, Rabiot, Miretti, Kostic; Church, Kean. Trainer. Cheer up.

Even if Real Madrid managed to find the back of the net early at Stamford Bridge – as they have done all season – a failure to put the game to bed would open the door for the Blues to dent the Gunners' early title aspirations.

Potter is yet to suffer defeat at Stamford Bridge, but Real Madrid have fond memories of recent trips to West London and were able to rest several key first-team stars in midweek, so we expect the Gunners to take advantage of the Blues' lead. UEFA Champions League - TODAY'S MATCH Defense and return to the Emirates with the three hard-earned points.
